The following fields exists in Schedule Appointment but are yet to be included in patient
information:
- date of birth
- hospital number

Change phoneNumber field in PersonalDetails to be list-oriented instead of comma-separated.
We actually should be using multiple phone numbers. Adjust in dto, dao, sql, and search.jsp
Method of retreiving hospital number or nhis number from search field is inefficient. We need a way to detect a selection event and store the needed ID's in an hidden text field. We can then retrieve the value later for processing.
